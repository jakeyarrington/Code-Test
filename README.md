# Code Test Scope
Included in the repository is a JSON (`people.json`) file containing an array of people and their details.

## Step 1. List users
We need to pull the information from the JSON file into a HTML page and list out the people and their details using either jQuery or Angular.js (preferred). For this task you must:

* Create a HTML file that contains your JS and CSS in-line
* Pull the data from the `people.json` file as a GET request
* List out the data onto the page in the styling shown below.
